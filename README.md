Air pollution is one of the serious environmental problems that is leading to millions of
premature deaths each year. Air quality monitoring systems will be one of the proactive
solutions for reducing deaths.
Our project provides air quality measurement and pollutant values(PM2.5, PM10, NO2,
NH3, CO, etc) of each city in India.
We have built our model using the Xgboost(Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm with high
accuracy of 99%. After that, we used an API to collect real-world pollutant values. With this
data we predicted air quality and with the help of tableau software, we have represented air
quality in India Map. Eventually, we integrated this map with a web application which is
developed using front-end technologies(HTML, CSS, and JS).

<!-- ## Supported data providers

- [Airly][airly] - over 20k sensor stations in many cities around the world in addition to data provided from third-party services like PurpleAir. Check the [Airly map][airly-map] for full coverage.

## Source code-only

Due to the reasons described in [this comment](https://github.com/jsynowiec/airqmon/issues/50#issuecomment-1008751034), I am no longer willing to cover the monthly costs associated with the Airqmon API and Google Geolocation.

I have removed all binaries from the current and previous releases as they will no longer work. You can host the Airqmon API on your own and clone the latest release to build your version of the app. -->
